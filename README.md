## Building Packages

Follow the instructions in [omnibus/README.md](omnibus/README.md).

## Docker-based Development Environment

Run `make shell` to start a Docker-based development environment. This will
start Postgres, run the database schema migrations, update the rebar
dependencies, and put you into a shell where you can run `make` to compile and
`make test` to run the tests.

## Local Development Environment

* Requires Erlang 18+
* Running instance of postgres 9.4+

### Setup the Schema

In the pushy\_server\_schema directory:

        make setup_schema

Add the following to `config/vars.config`: (Don't commit this change)

        {db_user, "<your local user account>"}.

In the root directory of this repository:

        make test
